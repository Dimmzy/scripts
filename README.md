________TF.py________
Used for saving and querying True/False values for specific indices as parsed from a formatted text file (T or F in each line corresponding index)
It parses the text file, saves the values as booleans in a tuple and asks for user input as to which index to return
Written mostly to be able to check answers to a list of true/false questions without accidentally seeing the answers to the neighboring questions.
